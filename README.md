### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niels, I'm 25 years old and I live in Belgium.

I'm currently working as an ML engineer @ [ðŸ¤—  HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), where I'm part of the Open-Source team.

I work on HuggingFace Transformers, a Python library implementing several state-of-the-art AI algorithms, all based on the original [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Google.

I love making AI more accessible to anyone. So far, I've contributed the following algorithms to HuggingFace Transformers:

- [LayoutLMv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08387), by Microsoft Research

Besides that, I help others add models to the library, including:
- [Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030), by Microsoft Research
- [mLUKE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08151), by Studio Ousia
- [NystrÃ¶mformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902), by University of Wisconsin-Madison
- [YOSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09714), by University of Wisconsin-Madison
- [PoolFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11418), by Sea AI Lab
- [CvT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15808), by Microsoft Research

I'm mostly working with PyTorch. For IDEs, I work with Visual Studio Code and Google Colab. It's all you need.

I learned everything about deep learning through self-study, mainly thanks to Andrej Karpathy's [cs231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University (lectures are free on Youtube and assigment solutions can be found on Github).

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niels, I'm 25 years old and I live in Belgium.

I'm currently working as an ML engineer @ [ðŸ¤—  HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), where I'm part of the Open-Source team.

I work on HuggingFace Transformers, a Python library implementing several state-of-the-art AI algorithms, all based on the original [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Google.

I love making AI more accessible to anyone. So far, I've contributed the following algorithms to HuggingFace Transformers:
- [TAPAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02349), by Google AI
- [ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), by Google AI
- [DEiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877), by Facebook AI
- [DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872), by Facebook AI
- [BEiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08254), by Microsoft Research
- [CANINE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06874), by Google AI
- [LUKE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01057), by Studio Ousia
- [LayoutLMv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14740) and [LayoutXLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08836), by Microsoft Research
- [TrOCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10282), by Microsoft Research

I'm mostly working with PyTorch. For IDEs, I work with Visual Studio Code and Google Colab. It's all you need.

I learned everything about deep learning through self-study, mainly thanks to Andrej Karpathy's [cs231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University (lectures are free on Youtube and assigment solutions can be found on Github).

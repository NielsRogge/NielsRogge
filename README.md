### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niels, I'm 25 years old and I live in Belgium.

I'm currently working as an ML engineer @ HuggingFace, where I'm part of the Open-Source team.

I love making AI more accessible to anyone. So far, I've contributed the following algorithms to HuggingFace Transformers:
- TAPAS, by Google AI
- ViT, by Google AI
- DEiT, by Facebook AI
- DETR, by Facebook AI
- BEiT, by Microsoft Research
- CANINE, by Google AI
- LUKE, by Studio Ousia
- LayoutLMv2 and LayoutXLM, by Microsoft Research
- TrOCR, by Microsoft Research

I'm mostly working with PyTorch. For IDEs, I work with Visual Studio Code and Google Colab. It's all you need.

I learned everything about deep learning through self-study, mainly thanks to Andrej Karpathy's [cs231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University (lectures are free on Youtube and assigment solutions can be found on Github).
